<p>
<em>dataset</em> is a command line tool, Go package, and an experimental C shared library for working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> objects as collections. Collections can be stored on local disc. JSON objects are stored in collections as plain UTF-8 text. This means the objects can be accessed with common Unix text processing tools as well as most programming languages. <em>dataset</em> is also available as a Python package, see <a href="https://github.com/caltechlibrary/py_dataset">py_dataset</a>
</p>
<p>
The <a href="docs/dataset.html">dataset</a> command line tool supports common data manage operations such as initialization of collections, creation, reading, updating and deleting JSON objects in the collection. Some of its enhanced features include the ability to generate data <a href="docs/frame.html">frames</a> as well as the ability to import, export and synchronize JSON objects to and from CSV files.
</p>
<p>
<em>dataset</em> is written in the <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a> programming language. It can be used as a Go package by other Go based software. Go supports generating C shared libraries. By compiling the Go source you can create a <em>libdataset</em> C shared library. The C shared library is currently being used by the Digital Library Development Group in Caltech Library from Python 3.8 (see <a href="https://github.com/caltecehlibrary/py_dataset" title="link to github repo for py_dataset">py_dataset</a>). This approach looks promising if you need support from other programming languages (e.g. <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> can call shared libraries easily with a ccall function).
</p>
<p>
See <a href="how-to/getting-started-with-dataset.html">getting-started-with-datataset.md</a> for a tour and tutorial. Include are both the command line as well as examples in Python using <a href="https://github.com/caltechlibrary/py_dataset">py_dataset</a>.

<h2 id="design-choices">
Design choices
</h2>
<p>
<em>dataset</em> isn’t a database or a replacement for repository systems. It is guided by the idea that you should be able to work with text files, the JSON objects documents, with standard Unix text utilities. It is intended to be simple to use with minimal setup (e.g.  <code>dataset init mycollection.ds</code> creates a new collection called ‘mycollection.ds’). It is built around a few abstractions – dataset stores JSON objects in collections, collections are folder(s) containing a pairtree of JSON object documents and any attachments, a collections.json file describing the mapping of keys to folder locations). <em>dataset</em> takes minimal system resources and keeps all content, except JSON object attachments, in plain UTF-8 text.
</p>
<p>
The choice of plain UTF-8 and future proof reading dataset collections.<br /> Care has been taken to keep <em>dataset</em> simple enough and light weight enough that it will run on a machine as small as a Raspberry Pi while being equally comfortable on a more resource rich server or desktop environment. It should be easy to do alternative implementations in any language having a good string library, JSON support and memory management.
</p>
<h2 id="workflows">
Workflows
</h2>
<p>
A typical library processing pattern is to write a “harvester” which then stores it results in a <em>dataset</em> collection. Write something that transforms or aggregates harvested options and then write a final rendering program to prepare the data for the web. The the hearvesters are typically written in Python or as a simple Bash scripts storing the results in a dataset collection. Depending on the performance needs transform and aggregates stages are written either in Python or Go and our final rendering stages are typically written in Python or as simple Bash scripts.

Features
</h2>
<p>
<a href="docs/dataset">dataset</a> supports
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Basic storage actions (<a href="docs/create.html">create</a>, <a href="docs/read.html">read</a>, <a href="docs/update.html">update</a> and <a href="docs/delete.html">delete</a>)
</li>
<li>
listing of collection <a href="docs/keys.html">keys</a> (including filtering and sorting)
</li>
<li>
import/export of <a href="how-to/working-with-csv.html">CSV</a> files
</li>
<li>
The ability to reshape data by performing simple object <a href="docs/join.html">joins</a>
</li>
<li>
The ability to create data <a href="docs/frame.html">frames</a> from collections based on keys lists and <a href="docs/dotpath.html">dot paths</a> into stored JSON objects
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can work with dataset collections via the <a href="docs/dataset.html">command line tool</a>, via Go using the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset">dataset package</a> or in Python 3.8 using the <a href="https://github.com/caltechlibrary/py_dataset">py_dataset</a> python package. <em>dataset</em> is useful for general data science applications which need intermediate JSON object management but not a full blown database.
</p>
<h3 id="limitations-of-dataset">
Limitations of <em>dataset</em>
</h3>
<p>
<em>dataset</em> has many limitations, some are listed below
</p>
<ul>
<li>
it is not a multi-process, multi-user data store (it’s files on “disc” without locking)
</li>
<li>
it is not a replacement for a repository management system
</li>
<li>
it is not a general purpose database system
</li>
<li>
it does not supply automatic version control on collections or objects
</li>
</ul>
