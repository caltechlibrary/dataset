<strong>dataset</strong> is a command line tool, a Go package, and an experimental C shared library for working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> objects as collections. Collections are stored on your local disk. JSON objects are stored in collections as plain UTF-8 text files. This means the objects can be accessed with common Unix text processing tools as well as most programming languages. <strong>dataset</strong> is also available as a Python package, see <a href="https://github.com/caltechlibrary/py_dataset">py_dataset</a>
</p>
<p>
The <a href="docs/dataset.html">dataset</a> command line tool supports common data management operations such as initialization of collections; document creation, reading, updating and deleting; listing keys of JSON objects in the collection.
</p>
<p>
<strong>datasets</strong>’s enhanced features include
</p>
<ul>
<li>
aggregate objects into data <a href="docs/frame.html">frames</a>
</li>
<li>
import, export and synchronize JSON objects to and from CSV files
</li>
<li>
generate sample sets of keys and objects
</li>
</ul>
<p>
See <a href="how-to/getting-started-with-dataset.html">Getting started with dataset</a> for a tour and tutorial. Both the command line and examples in Python 3 using using <a href="https://github.com/caltechlibrary/py_dataset">py_dataset</a> are included.

<h2 id="design-choices">
Design choices
</h2>
<p>
<strong>dataset</strong> isn’t a database or a replacement for a repository system. It is tool to manage JSON documents in a predictable and structured way. <strong>dataset</strong> is guided by the idea that you should be able to work with JSON documents as easily as you can any plain text document on Unix. <strong>dataset</strong> is intended to be simple to use with minimal setup (e.g.  <code>dataset init mycollection.ds</code> creates a new collection called ‘mycollection.ds’). It is built around the following abstractions
</p>
<ul>
<li>
dataset stores JSON objects in collections
</li>
<li>
collections are folder(s) containing
<ul>
<li>
collection.json metadata file
</li>
<li>
a pairtree of JSON object documents
</li>
<li>
support for attachments to JSON documents
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The choice of plain UTF-8 is intended to help future proof reading dataset collections. Care has been taken to keep <em>dataset</em> simple enough and light weight enough that it will run on a machine as small as a Raspberry Pi Zero while being equally comfortable on a more resource rich server or desktop environment. <strong>dataset</strong> can be re-implement in any programming language supporting file input and output, common string operations and a JSON encoding and decoding.
</p>
<h2 id="example-workflow">
Example Workflow
</h2>
<p>
A typical processing pattern is to write a “harvester” which then stores it results in a <strong>dataset</strong> collection. This is often followed by another program that transforms or aggregates harvested material before rendering a prepared output, e.g. web pages or data files. At Caltech Library the harvesters are typically written in Python or Bash storing the results in a dataset collection. Depending on the performance needs transform and aggregates stages are written either in Python or Go and our final rendering stages are typically written in Python or as simple Bash scripts.

Features
</h2>
<p>
<a href="docs/dataset">dataset</a> supports
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Basic storage actions (<a href="docs/create.html">create</a>, <a href="docs/read.html">read</a>, <a href="docs/update.html">update</a> and <a href="docs/delete.html">delete</a>)
</li>
<li>
listing of collection <a href="docs/keys.html">keys</a>
</li>
<li>
import/export of <a href="how-to/working-with-csv.html">CSV</a> files
</li>
<li>
The ability to reshape data by performing simple object <a href="docs/join.html">joins</a>
</li>
<li>
The ability to create data <a href="docs/frame.html">frames</a> from while collections or based on keys lists
<ul>
<li>
frames are defined using <a href="docs/dotpath.html">dot paths</a> describing what is to be pulled out of a stored JSON objects
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can work with dataset collections via the <a href="docs/dataset.html">command line tool</a>, via Go using the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset">dataset package</a> or in Python 3.8 using the <a href="https://github.com/caltechlibrary/py_dataset">py_dataset</a> python package. <em>dataset</em> is useful for general data science applications which need intermediate JSON object management but not a full blown database.
</p>
<h2 id="limitations-of-dataset">
Limitations of <strong>dataset</strong>
</h2>
<p>
<em>dataset</em> has many limitations, some are listed below
</p>
<ul>
<li>
it is not a multi-process, multi-user data store (it stores files on disk without locking)
</li>
<li>
it is not a replacement for a repository management system
</li>
<li>
it is not a general purpose database system
</li>
<li>
it does not supply automatic version control on collections, objects or attachments
</li>
<li>
it stores all keys to lower case in order to deal with file systems that are not case sensitive
</li>
<li>
it does not have a built-in query language for filtering or sorting
</li>
</ul>
