  "description": "The Dataset Project provides tools for working with collections of JSON documents easily. It uses a simple key and object pair to organize JSON documents into a collection. It supports SQL querying of the objects stored in a collection.\n\nIt is suitable for temporary storage of JSON objects in data processing pipelines as well as a persistent storage mechanism for collections of JSON objects.\n\nThe Dataset Project provides command line programs and a web service for working with JSON objects as a collection or individual objects. As such it is well suited for data science projects as well as building web applications that work with metadata.",

Help is being reorganizaed. api_doc.go and api_cmd.go was removed as it was dead code with changes in help implementaiton. \n\nThe `-help` option can pull up help on a topic by providing a keyword as a separate parameter. This let's you pull up help on the related commands. \n\nExample:\n\n~~~shell\ndataset -help api\ndastaet -help dsquery\n~~~\n\nHelp text is now maintain inside a single file, helptext.go.",
