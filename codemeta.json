  "description": "The Dataset Project provides tools for working with collections of JSON documents easily. It uses a simple key and object pair to organize JSON documents into a collection. It supports SQL querying of the objects stored in a collection.\n\nIt is suitable for temporary storage of JSON objects in data processing pipelines as well as a persistent storage mechanism for collections of JSON objects.\n\nThe Dataset Project provides command line programs and a web service for working with JSON objects as a collection or individual objects. As such it is well suited for data science projects as well as building web applications that work with metadata.",
