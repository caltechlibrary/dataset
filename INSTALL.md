Installation for development of **dataset**
===========================================

**dataset** The Dataset Project provides tools for working with collections of JSON documents easily. It uses a simple key and object pair to organize JSON documents into a collection. It supports SQL querying of the objects stored in a collection.

It is suitable for temporary storage of JSON objects in data processing pipelines as well as a persistent storage mechanism for collections of JSON objects.

The Dataset Project provides command line programs and a web service for working with JSON objects as a collection or individual objects. As such it is well suited for data science projects as well as building web applications that work with metadata.

Quick install with curl or irm
------------------------------

There is an experimental installer.sh script that can be run with the following command to install latest table release. This may work for macOS, Linux and if youâ€™re using Windows with the Unix subsystem. This would be run from your shell (e.g. Terminal on macOS).

~~~shell
curl https://caltechlibrary.github.io/dataset/installer.sh | sh
