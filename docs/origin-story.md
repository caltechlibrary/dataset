## Origin story

The inspiration for _dataset_ grew from the desire to process metadata as
JSON object collections using simple Unix shell utilities and data
pipelines. The core use case evolved at
[Caltech Library](https://library.caltech.edu) working with various
repository systems' API (e.g.
[EPrints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPrints) and 
[Invenio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invenio)). It has allowed the 
library to build an aggregated view of heterogeneous content 
(see https://feeds.library.caltech.edu) as well as facilitate ad-hoc 
analysis and data enhancement for a number of internal library projects.
