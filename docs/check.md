check
=====

syntax
------

```shell
    dataset check COLLECTION_NAME [COLLECTION_NAME ...]
```

Description
-----------

Check reviews one or more collections and reports if any problems 
are identified based on the `collection.json` file found in the 
folder holding the collection's pairtree. 

Usage
-----

If multiple instances of dataset write (e.g. create or update) to 
a collection then it is possible that the JSON file `collection.json` 
will become inaccurate.

```shell
    dataset check MyRecordCollection.ds
    dataset check MyBrokenCollection.ds MyRecordCollection.ds
```
