sample (deprecated)
===================

__dataset__ supports the concept of generating a random sample
of keys from a collection. To do this you need to use the `-sample`
The `-sample` option takes a positive integer value and returns a
list randomly selected list of keys.  If N is greater than the collection
then all keys are returned for the collection.
