## SYNOPSIS


dataset is a command line tool demonstrating dataset package for 
managing JSON documents stored on disc. A dataset is organized 
around collections, collections contain a pairtree holding specific 
JSON documents and related content.  In addition to the JSON 
documents dataset maintains metadata for management of the 
documents, their attachments as well as a ability to generate 
select lists based JSON document keys (aka JSON document names).



## OPTIONS

Options are shared between all actions and must precede the action 
on the command line.
