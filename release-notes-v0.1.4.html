<p>
This release has breaking changes with release v0.1.3 and early. Many functions in libdataset have been renamed to prevent collisions in the environments using libdataset C-shared library. Most function names now have two parts separated by a underscore (e.g. status has become collection_status, repair has become collection_repair).
</p>
<p>
Google Sheet integration has been dropped. It was just more trouble then it was worth to maintain.
</p>
<p>
Tests from py_dataset now have been ported to the test library for libdataset.
</p>
<p>
Redundant functions have been removed (we had accumulated multiple definitions for the same thing in libdataset). Where possible code has been simplified.
</p>
<p>
Most libdataset functions will cause an “open” on a dataset collection automatically. Some additional functions around collections have been added primarily to make testing eaisier (e.g. open_collection(), is_open(), close_collection(), close_all()).
</p>
<p>
Functions that were overloaded via optional parameters have been simplified. E.g. keys() now returns all keys in collection, use key_filter() and key_sort() accordingly.
