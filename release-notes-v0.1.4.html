<section>
<p>This release has breaking changes with release v0.1.3 and early.
Many functions in libdataset have been renamed to prevent collisions
in the environments using libdataset C-shared library. Most function
names now have two parts separated by a underscore (e.g. status
has become collection_status, repair has become collection_repair).</p>

<p>Google Sheet integration has been dropped. It was just more trouble
then it was worth to maintain.</p>

<p>Tests from py_dataset now have been ported to the test library for
libdataset.</p>

<p>Redundant functions have been removed (we had accumulated multiple
definitions for the same thing in libdataset). Where possible
code has been simplified.</p>

<p>Most libdataset functions will cause an &ldquo;open&rdquo; on a dataset collection
automatically. Some additional functions around collections have been
added primarily to make testing eaisier (e.g. open_collection(), is_open(),
close_collection(), close_all()).</p>

<p>Functions that were overloaded via optional parameters have been simplified.
E.g. keys() now returns all keys in collection, use key_filter() and key_sort() accordingly.</p>
