# Attachment ideas

### Attach (no other attachments)

1. calc basename of file to be attached as well as the 
   pairtree path including a `_docs` element before the basename
2. copy the file into place on attachment directory using the basename

### List attachments

1. scan for filenames using pairtree path plus `_docs` suffix 

### Delete specific attached file

1. calc pairtree path
2. delete item with path

### Delete all attachments

1. remove objects attachments from the pairtree path for containing `_docs` 

## Extending dataset's reach with shared libraries

### Python

Use [py_dataset](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/py_dataset).

## Metadata for collections

A dataset collection contains a codemeta.json file describing the
collection as well as a list of keys in the collection.
