# Go based C-Shared libraries on Mac OS X 10.x

When I use multiple Go based C-Shared libraries from Python 3.7 I get a 
runtime error, "runtime/cgo: could not obtain pthread keys".  This appears 
to be a Go linking issue for Mac OS X 10.x and Go 1.10.x. It appears that 
when the go runtime starts on the second shared library that it can't 
find the **pthread_keys** entry point.  This appears to be a known but 
unresolved, see issue [#17200](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/17200) 
in Go's Github repository. It appears this problem goes back several years 
and re-occurs in numerious forms.  It doesn't appear to be solvable 
without seriously hacking the Go linker based on the version of Go an OS 
you're using.
