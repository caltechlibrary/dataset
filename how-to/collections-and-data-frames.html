COLLECTIONS AND FRAMES
</h1>
<p>
<strong>dataset</strong> stores JSON objects and can store also data
frames similar to that used in Python, R and Julia. This document
outlines the ideas behind <strong>dataset</strong>’s implementation of
data frames.
</p>
<h2 id="collections">
COLLECTIONS
</h2>
<p>
Collections are at the core of the <strong>dataset</strong> tool. A
collection is either a pairtree directory structure storing JSON objects
in plain text or a SQL table with a JSON column for the object. Both
support optional attachments. The root folder should contain two files
<em>collection.json</em> and <em>codemeta.json</em>.
<em>collection.json</em> file contains operational metadata, metadata
that dataset needs to work with the collection of JSON documents. The
<em>codemeta.json</em> file is general metadata describing the
collection. See <a href="https://codemete.github.io">codemeta</a> for
details on the <em>codemeta.json</em> file structure.
</p>
<p>
For the pairtree based collections one of the guiding ideas behind has
been to keep everything in plain text (i.e. UTF-8) whenever reasonable.
The affords the opportunity to easily interact with the data via
standard Unix tools or easily from any language that supports working
with JSON documents. A pairtree to a large degree is future proof as it
is very likely the ability to read the file system and text files will
persist long after dataset development stops.
</p>
<p>
Over the course of the last several years the limitations of storing
JSON documents directly on the file system have been more compelling.
Additionally common, mature SQL database systems have pickup the ability
to store JSON as a column type (e.g. current systems include SQLite3,
MySQL 8, Postgres 14). With version 2 of dataset this ability has been
embraced more directly. Collections of the JSON documents can be stored
in a table in a supported database. While this is less future proof than
plain text it does increase the flexibility of working with large
collections, likewise a dataset collection running with a SQL storage
engine can be cloned to a pairtree storage collection for long term
preservation.
</p>
<p>
The dataset project provides Go package for working with dataset
collections. This means you can use dataset as a storage engine directly
in your own Go based projects. As of version 2 this is documented along
with command line interactions.
</p>
<p>
Dataset isn’t a database (there are plenty of JSON oriented databases
out there, e.g. CouchDB, MongoDB and No SQL storage systems for MySQL
and Postgresql). <strong>dataset</strong>’s focus is on providing a
mechanism to manage JSON documents (objects). It supports the ability to
attach non-JSON documents to a JSON document record as well as for
working with JSON collections as data frames. Dataset collections are
like a mini repository system avoiding the complexity of more mature
repostiory back ends like <a href="https://duraspace.org/fedora/">Fedora
Repository</a>.
</p>
<p>
By working with JSON documents dataset can be used to feed full text
search engines like <a href="https://solr.apache.org/">Solr</a>, <a
href="https://www.opensearch.org/">OpenSearch</a>, and small engines
like <a href="https://lunrjs.com/">LunrJS</a>. Likewise when combined
with Go’s struct types can be used to support building structured data
repositories customized to specific needs.
</p>
<h2 id="data-frames">
DATA FRAMES
</h2>
<p>
Working with subsets of data in a collection is useful, particularly
ordered subsets. Implementing this started me thinking about the
similarity to data frames in Python, Julia and Octave. A <em>frame</em>
is an ordered list of objects. Frames can be retrieved as a list of
objects or as a list of keys. Frames contain a additional metadata to
help them persist. Frames include enough metadata to efficiently refresh
framed objects or even replace all objects in the list based on a new
set of keys.
</p>
<p>
<strong>dataset</strong> stores frames with the collection so they are
is available for later processing. The objects in a frame reflect the
objects as they existed when the frame was generated. Frames can be
refreshed to match the current state of the collection.
</p>
<p>
Frames become handy when moving data from JSON documents (tree like) to
other formats like spreadsheets (table like). This is because the data
frame’s structure is defined based on paths into objects in the
collections. These pathes are mapped to “labels” structure the framed
objects. Frames can be used to simplify a complex record into a simpler
model for indexing in your favorite search engine.
</p>
<p>
Frames are stored in the collection’s <code>_frames</code> sub
directory. One JSON document per frame combining both the definition and
frame content.
</p>
<h2 id="frame-operations">
FRAME OPERATIONS
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
frame (define a frame)
</li>
<li>
frame-def (read a frame definition, i.e. name, dot paths and labels)
</li>
<li>
frame-objects (read a frame’s object list)
</li>
<li>
frame-keys (read a frame’s key list)
</li>
<li>
frames (return a list of frame names)
</li>
<li>
reframe (replace all frame objects with objects indicated by a new list
of keys)
</li>
<li>
refresh (update objects in a frame while pruning objects no longer in
the collection)
</li>
<li>
has-frame (check to see if a frame exists in the collection)
</li>
<li>
delete-frame
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="create-a-frame">
Create a frame
</h3>
<p>
Example creating a frame named “dois-and-titles”
</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>    dataset keys Pubs.ds &gt;pubs.keys
    dataset frame-create -i pubs.keys Pubs.ds dois-and-titles \
        &quot;.doi=DOI&quot; \
        &quot;.title=Title&quot;</code></pre>
<h3 id="retrieve-an-existing-frames-objects">
Retrieve an existing frame’s objects
</h3>
<p>
An example of getting the frame’s object list only.
</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>    dataset frame-objects Pubs.ds dois-and-titles</code></pre>
<h3 id="regenerating-a-frame">
Regenerating a frame
</h3>
<p>
Regenerating “dois-and-titles”.
</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>    dataset refresh Pubs.ds dois-and-titles</code></pre>
<h3 id="updating-keys-associated-with-the-frame">
Updating keys associated with the frame
</h3>
<p>
In this example we want to “reframe” our “titles-and-dois” data frame.
We get the current list of keys in the collection and regenerate the
objects in the data frame using the new list of keys.
</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>    dataset Pubs.ds keys &gt;updated.keys
    dataset reframe -i updated.keys Pubs.ds titles-and-dios</code></pre>
<h3 id="removing-a-frame">
Removing a frame
</h3>
<pre class="shell"><code>    dataset delete-frame Pubs.ds titles-and-dios</code></pre>
<h2 id="listing-available-frames">
Listing available frames
</h2>
<pre class="shell"><code>    dataset frames Pubs.ds</code></pre>
