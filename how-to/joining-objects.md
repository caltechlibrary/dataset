Joining Objects
===============

You can augment JSON key/value pairs for a JSON document in your
collection using the join operation. This works similar to the datatools
cli called jsonjoin.

In this example our collection is called *people.ds*. Let\'s assume you
have a record in your collection with a key \'jane.doe\'. It has three
fields - name, email, age.

``` {.json}
    {"name":"Doe, Jane", "email": "jd@example.org", "age": 42}
```

You also have an external JSON document called profile.json. It looks
like

``` {.json}
    {"name": "Doe, Jane", "email": "jane.doe@example.edu", "bio": "world renowned geophysist"}
```

You can merge the unique fields in profile.json with your existing
jane.doe record

``` {.shell}
    dataset join people.ds jane.doe profile.json
```

The result would look like

``` {.json}
    {"name":"Doe, Jane", "email": "jd@example.org", "age": 42, "bio": "renowned geophysist"}
```

If you wanted to overwrite the common fields you would use \'join
overwrite\'

``` {.shell}
    dataset join -overwrite people.ds jane.doe profile.json
```

Which would result in a record like

``` {.json}
    {"name":"Doe, Jane", "email": "jane.doe@example.edu", "age": 42, "bio": "renowned geophysist"}
```
