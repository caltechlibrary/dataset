<h1 id="how-attachments-work">How Attachments Work</h1>
<p>The primary use case of the <strong>dataset</strong> tool is managing
JSON documents. There exist a common secondary use case of including
support for "attached" non-JSON documents. Example 1, when we harvest
content from a system who does not support JSON natively it is handy to
keep a version of the harvested content for audit purposes. The EPrints
system has a REST API that returns XML. Storing the original EPrint XML
document gives the developer an ability to verify that their JSON
rendering matches the EPrint XML should their JSON needs change in the
future.</p>
<p>This raises questions of how to keep things simple while supporting
an arbitrary number of attachments for JSON object document? How do you
handle versioning when some types of collections need it for attachments
and others don't?</p>
<p>The <strong>dataset</strong> command line tool and related Go package
store the attachments un-versioned by default in the pairtree. The
un-versioned attached document is stored in a pairtree in the
“attachments” folder of the collection. This is true regardless of the
storage engine used (e.g. pairtree storage, sql storage). The attached
document is stored by its basename. The basename must be unique among
the documents attached otherwise it will be overwritten when attaching
another document using the same basename.</p>
<p>If you need versioning you create your collection with versioning
support. Attaching the documents will automatically version based on the
basename of the attachment. When retrieving a specific version you need
to support a <a href="https://semver.org">semver</a> using the
appropraite versioned verb. By default reads will be the current version
of the document, meaning the version with the “largest” semver value. In
a versioned collection two files with the same basename will result in
different “versions” of the document with the highest semver reflecting
the most recent addition.</p>
<p>It is easier to see with this example. We have a dataset collection
called "Sea-Mamals.ds". We have a JSON object stored called "walrus". We
want to attach "notes-on-walrus.docx" which is on our local drive under
"/Users/fred/Documents/notes-on-walrus.docx".</p>
<p>Using the <strong>dataset</strong> cli you issue the follow command
--</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>    dataset create Sea-Mamals.ds walrus &#39;{&quot;description&quot;: &quot;may have tusks&quot;, &quot;size&quot;: &quot;impressive&quot;}&#39;
    dataset attach Sea-Mamals.ds walrus \
       /Users/fred/Documents/notes-on-walrus.docx</code></pre>
<p>The results in a simple directory stricture for the JSON object and
attachment.</p>
<pre><code>    Sea-Mamanls/pairtree/wa/lr/us/walrus.json
    Sea-Mamanls/attachments/wa/lr/us/notes-on-walrus.docx</code></pre>
<p>The directory structured for versioned attachments and JSON document
is more complex. In the case of the JSON document the semver gets
embedded in the JSON document name while the attachments are stored in
subfolders by version. The assignment of the semver is automatic based
on the collection’s original setup.</p>
<h2 id="how-attachments-look-in-the-json-object">How Attachments look in
the JSON Object</h2>
<p>In version 2 of dataset the JSON document remain unmodified. You will
nolonger see added attributes like <code>_Key</code> or
<code>_Attachments</code> in the object. Likewise attachments will
remain unaltered beyond remaining the file path to the basename when the
attachment is made. Versions are in their own version folder.</p>
