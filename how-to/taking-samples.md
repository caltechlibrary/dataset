# Samples

_dataset keys_ and _dataset find ..._ support the `-sample` option. 
The sample option expects a sample size as an argument. If the sample 
size is greater than zero then a sample output will be taken.  On 
_dataset keys_ the sample is taken after any filter is supplied.  
Likewise for _dataset find_ the sample is taken after the query results 
have been calculated. Is the sample size is greater then the results 
returned then the who results set is return without random sampling.  
If sample size is less than result set then a random sampling of the 
results is taken.

If you are doing Machine Leaning type of sampling (e.g. calculating a 
test and training set) then normally you create a *test* key list like 
this 

```
    dataset -sample="$N" keys
``` 

where 

```
    $N
```

holds the test sample size. 
After keylist is generated you can then create a training set by 
excluding the keys associated with the sample.
