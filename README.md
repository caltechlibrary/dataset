## What is dataset?

Dataset provides a means of easily curating collections of JSON objects as documents. It leverages SQL as a query language but does not require to you design SQL schema ahead of time. It can store a collection of hetrogenious objects or homogenious objects. It's your choice.

The Dataset Project comes with following tools for working with collections of JSON documents. Serveral programs provided as part of the Dataset Project.

dataset
: A command line program for working with JSON documents as a collection

datasetd
: A web service that allows managing JSON document collections via a web service (nice platform for web applictions). It includes support for digital assets should they exist in a collection

models
: This allows you to enforce data models, expressed in YAML documents, on a dataset collection.

digiset
: This is a tool to manages an digital assets related to a dataset collection JSON object. The "attached" digital assets are stored in an OCFL v1.1 compatible directory structure in the collection using the asset version number and pairtree (e.g. `assets/v1/...`).

These are enough to form the foundation for a light weight repository systems while remaining preservation friendly (e.g. via BagIt and RO-Crates).

## Why or when should I use Dataset v3?

Dataset is a means of storing collections of JSON objects either temporary processing or as a long term storage destination.

The dataset collection is [BagIt]() and [RO-Create]() friendly. That means it should easily fit into your preservation workflow.

By default JSON objects are stored in an SQLite3 database. They can easily be rendered to a JSON lines file for persistence and bagged along with the SQLite3 database. Alternately a dataset3 collection can point to a PostgreSQL database for JSON document storage. Similarly digital assets associated with a collection may point out to an S3 object store using a OCFL v1.1 layout.

Because Dataset V3 follows the RO-Crate specification for both JSON documents and digital assets it fits into many data science workflows.

Dataset V3 also provides a simple web service that can be the basis for web application development. Example, a light weight repository system. It provides a simple JSON API using browser supported HTTP methods (i.e. GET and POST) and digital asset functionality. The dataset V3 web application can support multiple dataset collections using the same JSON API allowing you to aggregate content browser side as needed using standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As a web service Dataset plays nicely in your web stack too. It is light weight can can be treated as a micro service.

Dataset v3 stores JSON documents using a SQL engine with JSON column support. These days that most popular SQL implementations support JSON columns (e.g. SQLite3, PostgreSQL, MySQL). V3 uses a extremely simple table structure for both the current object state and object history as well as integration with the SQL's growing support for working with JSON objects generally.

Two tools are provided by the Dataset Project v3

[dataset3](dataset3.1.md)
: is a command line interface for managing JSON documents and their related digital assets

[dataset3d](dataset3d.1.md)
: JSON Web Service for JSON documents and digital assets. It also provides a static website support.

Design choices
--------------

__dataset3__ and __dataset3d__ are intended to be simple tools for managing collections JSON object documents in a predictable structured way.

__dataset3__ is guided by the idea that you should be able to work with JSON documents as easily as you can any plain text document on the Unix command line. _dataset_ is intended to be simple to use with minimal setup (e.g.  `dataset3 init mycollection.ds` creates a new collection called 'mycollection.ds').

__dataset3__ and __dataset3d__ store JSON object documents in collections.

- Storage in a SQL database using JSON columns (example SQLite3, or PostgreSQL and MySQL 8 with extra configuration)
- dataset collections are made up of a directory containing a collection.json and codemeta.json files.
- collection.json metadata file describing the collection, e.g. storage type, name, description, if versioning is enabled
- codemeta.json is a [codemeta](https://codemeta.github.io) file describing the nature of the collection, e.g. authors, description, funding
- collection objects are accessed by their key, a unique identifier made of lower case alpha numeric characters
- collection names are usually lowered case and usually have a `.ds` extension for easy identification

__dataset3d__ provides a web service has the following constraints.

- is intended as a back end web service run on localhost
  - by default it runs on localhost port 8485
  - supports collections that use the SQL storage engine
- **should never be used as a public facing web service**
  - there are no user level access mechanisms
  - anyone with access to the web service end point has access to the dataset collection content


The choice of plain UTF-8 is intended to help future proof reading dataset collections.  Care has been taken to keep _dataset_ simple enough and light weight enough that it will run on a machine as small as a Raspberry Pi Zero while being equally comfortable on a more resource rich server or desktop environment. _dataset_ can be re-implement in any programming language supporting file input and output, common string operations and along with JSON encoding and decoding functions. The current implementation is in the Go language.


Features
--------

-[dataset3](docs/dataset3.md) supports
- [init](docs/init.md), Initialize a new dataset collection
  - Define metadata about the collection using a codemeta.json file
  - Define a keys file holding a list of allocated keys in the collection
  - Creates a pairtree for object storage
- Codemeta file support for describing the collection contents
- Simple JSON object versioning
- List [keys](docs/keys.md) in a collection
  - [haskey](docs/has-key.md)
- [query](docs/query.md), Run SQL against a collection, return lists of metadata objects
- Object level actions
  - [write](docs/write.md), write a metadata object to a collection
  - [read](docs/read.md), read (retrieve) a metadata object from a collection
  - [remove](docs/remove.md), Deaccession a metadata object from the current collection (history is maintained)
  - [purge](docs/purge.md), Deletes removed objects from the current collection and history
- Digital Asset actions (a.k.a. "attachments")
  - [attach](docs/attach.md), Associate a digital asset with a collection key and store in the collection
  - [retrieve](docs/retrieve.md), Retrieves a list of digital assets attached to the collection key. If an object filename is included then that is written to standard out. If a filename and destination is included it i copyied out to the destination.
  - [detach](docs/detach), Deaccession a digital assets int the collection collection key (analogous to remove for a metadata object)
  - [prune](docs/prune.md), Purge removed digital assets from a collecton (analogous to purge for JSON documents)
- [dump](docs/dump.md), Write out a collection as a stream of JSON lines, objects written are loadable
- [load](docs/load.md), Read a JSON lines stream and populate a collection


If attachments are configured via a `dataset3d` YAML configuration then the following additional verbs are `attachments` attribute. The dataset tools will need the appropriate file permissions to support attachment operations. The YAML configuration should have the same name as the dataset collection but end with the `.yaml` instead of `.ds`. E.g. if my collection is called "mydata.ds" the attachment configuration is "mydata.yaml" in the same directory.

[dataset3d](docs/dataset3d.md) supports

- List [collections](docs/collections-endpoint.md) available from the web service
- List a [collection](collection-endpoint.md)'s metadata
- List a collection's [Keys](docs/keys-endpoint.md)
- Object level actions
  - [write](docs/write-endpoint.md)
  - [read](docs/read-endpoint.md)
  - [delete](docs/delete-endpoint.md)
  - [query](docs/query-endpoint.md) (for queries defined in the configuration YAML file)
- Digital Object and attachment integration uses the URL path prefix of `/da/<VERSION_NO>/<PAIRTREEE>/<OBJECT_BASENAME>`. The path corresponds to the OCLF v1.1 spec with the addition of `<VERSION_NO>` can be a text string like "released" or "latest".
  
Both __dataset3__  and __dataset3d__ maybe useful for general data science applications needing JSON object management or in implementing repository systems in research libraries and archives.


Limitations of __dataset3__ and __dataset3d__
---------------------------------------------

__dataset3__ has many limitations, some are listed below

- it is not a general purpose database system
- it stores all keys in lower case in order to deal with file systems
  that are not case sensitive, compatibility needed by a pairtree
- it stores collection names as lower case to deal with file systems that
  are not case sensitive
- it does not have a built-in query language, search or sorting. Instead
  it relies on the SQL engine's SQL dialect for manipulating the JSON objects
- it should NOT be used for sensitive or secret information

__dataset3d__ is a simple web service intended to run on local host, e.g. "localhost:8485".

- it does not include support for authentication
- it does not support user, role or ACL access control
- it does not provide auto key generation
- it limits the size of JSON documents stored to the size supported by
  with host SQL JSON columns
- it limits the size of attached files to less than 250 MiB
- it does not support partial JSON record updates or retrieval
- it does not provide an interactive Web UI for working with dataset
  collections
- it does not support HTTPS or "at rest" encryption
- it should NOT be used for sensitive or secret information
