# NAMe AS TExt

    namaste

Namaste is a practice of creating files with specific names
in a directory to indicate the purpose and usefulness of the
directory's content. In other words it allows us to add metadata
about the directory around the concepts of type, who, what, where, 
and when. "Name as text" has shorthanded by the phrase "namaste".

Name as text is used in libraries, archives in the context of 
managing digital collections an preservation. It can easily be 
"backported" to existing practices and technology where text files 
in directories occur. This allows for enhancing legacy systems as 
well as better for future needs.

Namaste is used to decorate the dataset collection with metadata
that can be used along with collection.json to describe a collection
in codemeta.json as well as a root index.html file.
